These third parties may use your personal information only as authorized by their contracts with us.

Third-party platforms and social media networks. If you have enabled features or functionality that connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network (such as by connecting your account with a third party to the Services or sharing content via a third-party platform), we will only disclose personal information that you have authorized us to share. We do not control the third party's use of personal information.
