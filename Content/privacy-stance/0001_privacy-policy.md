● Providing and improving our services. We or our third party partners use your information to provide services to you. This includes things like verifying your provided contact information so you can access the services, facilitating your transactions and enabling you to purchase cryptocurrency or communicate with other users.  We also use your information to improve our existing services and develop new ones.  For example, we track how you use our Services and use that information to troubleshoot issues and adjust things to improve your experience.

● Communicating with you and connecting you with others. We may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our Services. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can change your user account setting or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  Even if you unsubscribe from some email subscriptions, we may still need to email you with important transactional or other non-advertising information.  For example, there are certain service notification and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the Services or policies, customer support, and user-initiated communications (e.g., our responding to comments, chats, questions, and requests you send us).  If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.

We use the information we collect about you and your activity on our Services to personalize our offers.  We also use it to show advertising, content, or features that we think you might like.  This includes things like customized search results that match your preferences and prior search criteria.  We do not, however, use your transactional and/or financial information for these personalization purposes.  

● Protecting the rights of MobileCoin and others. There may be instances when MobileCoin may use or disclose your information, including situations where MobileCoin has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of MobileCoin or our employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of service); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of our Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

We understand that sharing information with third parties is a big responsibility.  We're committed to sharing information only when needed for a legitimate business or legal purpose, and then only with recipients who we believe will protect it.

● Information you ask us to share.  We share information when you ask us to share it. For example, if you choose to connect to another user through our Services, we will send them your name,  public wallet address and avatar.

● Service providers and business partners.  When MobileCoin hires a service provider to help operate our business, we may need to give them access to information to provide their service.  We allow them to use the information only to perform the service we've asked them to perform.  When MobileCoin partners with other businesses to offer products and services to you, we may share information with those partners as needed to provide those products and services and only subject to the terms of this Policy.

● Legal and compliance transfers. When MobileCoin needs to share data to satisfy a legal or regulatory requirement, including responding to a subpoena or other lawful government request for data, we will share information only as necessary to comply with that requirement.  We may also share information if needed to enforce our legal rights, detect or prevent fraud or security concerns, and protect public safety.  Recipients of your personal information may be law enforcement, government or regulatory bodies, authorities, or other authorized third parties.

● In connection with a merger, acquisition, or business transfer.  If MobileCoin is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of transfer or sale of some or all of its business, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, we may share your information with parties that are involved in the transaction.

● Public and deidentified data.  We may share information that is collected from public sources or that you choose to share publicly with third parties.  We may also share aggregated and/or deidentified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

● Sales of personal information. MobileCoin allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies, pixels, and similar technologies on our sites, which allow those companies to receive information about your activity on MobileCoin that is associated with your browser or device.  The companies may use that data to serve you more relevant ads on our sites or others.  Under some state laws, sharing data for online advertising like this may be considered a "sale" of information.  Except for this kind of sharing, MobileCoin doesn't sell any of your information for monetary consideration or value.

You have choices about how these technologies work on your devices.  You can disable them entirely using our cookie consent preference tools or by clicking the "Do Not Sell My Information  " link on our website.

Cookies, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies 

We and our partners use various tools to collect data when you visit our sites and apps, including cookies, pixels, localStorage, and other similar technologies.  Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device.  Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).  Our Services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.

When you use MobileCoin, we and our partners may use also use these technologies to gather information about how you view and use our services and content, and to connect your activity with other data we store about you.  The use of these technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you're interested in, tracking trends, measuring the effectiveness of ads, saving your preferences, and storing information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis.  We also allow specific, approved partners to collect data from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own similar tools.

At any time, you can control the use of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable some or all cookies, please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content, or personalization available through our Services.

In addition, if you give your email address to us, we may use a scrambled form (called a "hashed" version) of your email address to deliver tailored ads to you on MobileCoin or on other websites, including via Custom Audience Feature or other similar tools.  

For information about how you can manage your cookie and similar technologies preferences, check out the section of this Policy called "Your privacy tools and choices."  You can also visit our [Cookie Policy](https://mobilecoin.com/privacy-stance/cookie-policy/).

At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals. 

Managing communications preferences

We (or our service providers and advertising partners) may send you direct marketing communications and information about our products and services that we consider may be of interest to you and, where required by law, we will ask for your consent at the time we collect your personal information to conduct any of these types of marketing.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will provide an option to unsubscribe or opt-out of further communication on any electronic marketing communication sent to you or you may opt out by contacting us as set out in the "Contact Us" section below.

Please note that when you request an opt-out, it often takes some time to process these requests.  Therefore, it is possible that you may receive promotions scheduled prior to our receipt of your withdrawal of consent.

If you opt out of or do not provide your consent to receiving marketing or commercial communications, we retain the right to send you non-marketing communications such as correspondence about your relationship with us, information about transactions, or notifying you of updates to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service.
