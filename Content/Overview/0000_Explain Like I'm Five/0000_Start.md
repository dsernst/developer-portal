To help understand the importance of the MobileCoin technology, the ELI5 articles deliver four layers of increasingly more complex information geared toward describing the concepts to:

-   Five-year-old children who probably have never spent money

-   Grandparents who probably are not familiar with cryptocurrency, but have searched on Google, written checks, balanced their checkbooks, and transacted online through their local banks.

-   College first years who are familiar with digital cash, like Bitcoin, smartphones, and messaging apps, like Signal and WhatsApp.

-   Software engineers who have studied digital payment systems, blockchain databases, and cryptography.
